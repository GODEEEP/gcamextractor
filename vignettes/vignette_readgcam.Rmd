`gcamextractor` is a package to extract GCAM data into standardized data tables which can be used downstream in other models. `gcamextractor` uses `rgcam` to connect to GCAM databases and then processes the data into more commonly used units as well as re-organizes the data into tables with common column names. This allows all the data to be saved in combined tables. Additionally, `gcamextractor` aggregates data by parameter, class 1 and class 2. This allows users to quickly plot and analyze data at different degrees of detail. 

`gcamextractor::readgcam` will return a list as csv files as well directly as a list of R tables containing: 

* data: a dataframe with the original data
* dataAggParam: a dataframe with the data aggregated to the parameter
* dataAggClass1: a dataframe with the data aggregated to class 1
* dataAggclass2: a dataframe with the data aggregated to class 2
* dataAll: a dataframe with the original data as well as original queries and values before any conversions
* scenarios: A list of the scenarios
* queries: A list of the queries used to extract the data


The figure below shows the workflow of how `gcamextractor` connects to a GCAM database and its outputs.

```{r, eval=F}

library(gcamextractor)

path_to_gcam_database <- "E:/gcamfolder/output/database_ref" # Change the path based on your GCAM database location
gcamextractor::params # view available parameters
dataGCAM <- gcamextractor::readgcam(gcamdatabase = path_to_gcam_database,
                                    regionsSelect = c("Colombia"), # Set to "All" to read in all available regions
                                    paramsSelect = "pop",
                                    folder = "my_output_folder")  # Set to "All" to read in all available params

# View your data
df <- dataGCAM$data; df
dfParam <- dataGCAM$dataAggParam; dfParam
dfClass1 <- dataGCAM$dataAggClass1; dfClass1
dfClass2 <- dataGCAM$dataAggClass1; dfClass2

```

# Read GCAM .Proj file

Initial extraction of GCAM data can take a while and so `gcamextractor` also includes the option to save the raw extracted outputs as `.Proj` files which can be shared and read in as well. A default example `.Proj` file `gcamextractor::exmapleGCAMproj` is included with the package. The following script shows how this can be read into `gcamextractor`.

```{r, eval=F}
library(gcamextractor)

dataGCAM <- gcamextractor::readgcam(dataProjFile = gcamextractor::example_gcamv54_argentina_colombia_2025_proj, # Or provide path to .proj file
                                    folder = "my_output_folder")

```

The following figure shows the column headers of the `dataAll` outputs from gcamextractor. Other tables have a subset of these columns, such as in the case of `data` which only keeps relevant columns and drops columns such as `origScen` and `origQuery` which refer to the original data in GCAM. Other tables such as `dataAggClass1` removes the `class 2` columns and then aggregates the data over `class 1` variables.

Users can get a list of all available params and queries as shown below. The [parameters](https://jgcri.github.io/gcamextractor/articles/vignette_parameters.html) page lists details on each parameter, how it was calculated and cites any sources when available. `gcamextractor::map_param_query` gives a list of all parameters and the corresponding queries used to extract that data from GCAM. Additionally, `gcamextractor::map_param_query` also groups the various parameters into higher level groups which can then be called in the `paramSelect` argument of `gcamextractor` to extractor all the params in those groups. The groups also include curated parameters for particular models such as `CERF` and `GO`.

```{r, eval=F}
library(gcamextractor)

gcamextractor::params # Get all params
gcamextractor::queries # Get all queries used
gcamextractor::map_param_query # Get a table of params and the relevants queries used to extract and calculate them.

```
